  abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Results from recent genome-wide association
	studies indicate that for most complex traits, there are many loci
	that contribute to variation in observed phenotype and that the effect
	of a single variant (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP) on a phenotype
	is small. Here, we propose a method that combines the effects of
	multiple SNPs to make a prediction of a phenotype that has not been
	observed. We apply the method to data on mice, using phenotypic and
	genomic data from some individuals to predict phenotypes in other,
	either related or unrelated, individuals. We find that correlations
	between predicted and actual phenotypes are in the range of 0.4 to
	0.9. The method also shows that the SNPs used in the prediction appear
	in regions that are known to contain genes associated with the traits
	studied. The prediction of unobserved phenotypes from high-density
	SNP data and appropriate statistical methodology is feasible and
	can be applied in human medicine, forensics, or artificial breeding
	programs.</p>},
