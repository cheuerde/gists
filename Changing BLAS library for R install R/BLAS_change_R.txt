# it is straightforward to change the BLAS-library that is used by an R-instance.
# For this we can use the environmental variable LD_PRELOAD.
# This variable will load any library specified prior to all others, so we
# can define a priority for certain libraries
#
# So in terms of R we would do something like this:

# imagine my BLAS-library is located in /home/user/myBLAS/BLAS.so

# invoke R with 'myBLAS'

LD_PRELOAD=/home/user/myBLAS/BLAS.so R

# For convenience we could define scripts for various BLAS libraries
